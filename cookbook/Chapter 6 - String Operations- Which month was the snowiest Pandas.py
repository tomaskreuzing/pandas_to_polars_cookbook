# You'll see that the 'Weather' column has a text description of the weather that was going on each hour. We'll assume it's snowing if the text description contains "Snow".
# Pandas provides vectorized string functions, to make it easy to operate on columns containing text. There are some great examples: "http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/basics.html#vectorized-string-methods" in the documentation.
weather_description = weather_2012["Weather"]

# Let's plot when it snowed and when it did not:
is_snowing = is_snowing.astype(float)

# If we wanted the median temperature each month, we could use the `resample()` method like this:
weather_2012["temperature_c"].resample("ME").apply(np.median).plot(kind="bar")
plt.show()

# Unsurprisingly, July and August are the warmest.

# TODO: and now in Polars


# %%
# So we can think of snowiness as being a bunch of 1s and 0s instead of `True`s and `False`s:
is_snowing.astype(float)[:10]

# and then use `resample` to find the percentage of time it was snowing each month
is_snowing.astype(float).resample("M").apply(np.mean).plot(kind="bar")
plt.show()

# So now we know! In 2012, December was the snowiest month. Also, this graph suggests something that I feel -- it starts snowing pretty abruptly in November, and then tapers off slowly and takes a long time to stop, with the last snow usually being in April or May.
