# Pandas cookbook

This repo was copied from [pandas_cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook). Do have a
look at the original.

There are several chapters that guide you through how to use pandas in the
[cookbook folder](./cookbook). It will be your job to create a cookbook for polars.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repo.
2. Clone the forked repo and open it in VS Code.
3. Create a virtual environment from the environment.yml:
4. Select this environment as your interpreter in VS Code.

## Objective

Refactor the "Pandas cookbook" repository into a "Polars cookbook," showcasing common
functionalities of the Polars library.

## Background

A common task as a data scientist is refactoring code. Refactoring code involves improving its
readability, efficiency, or adapting it to use different libraries. This exercise focuses on
rewriting Pandas code using Polars, a relatively new data manipulation library.

By completing this assignment, you'll create a valuable "Polars cookbook" on your GitHub profile
that demonstrates common data manipulation tasks using the Polars library.

Polars is quickly gaining popularity because of its nice syntax and speed.

## Tasks

1. Fork the repository from the Cambridge-FDS workspace:
   https://github.com/cambridge-FDS/pandas_to_polars_cookbook
2. Divide the chapters among team members, ensuring each person is responsible for at least one
   chapter of the cookbook.
3. Rewrite each Pandas implementation using Polars. Note that sometimes this might not be directly
   possible. Particularly plotting is harder with a Polars data frame at the moment.
4. Create a separate Pull Request (PR) for each change implemented.
5. Have team members review each other's PRs to ensure everyone gains exposure to various Pandas
   and Polars functionalities across all chapters.

## Guidelines

- Keep Pull Requests concise and focused on specific changes.
- Each team member should provide PR reviews to maximise learning opportunities.
- After forking the repo, team members can clone it directly from their teammate's GitHub page.
